# AllStar-Footy-Analyser-v0.01

By default, this program reads any game file in the 'Games' folder that is placed in the same directory.
If the directory does not have a folder named 'Games' in it, it will be created when the program is run for the first time.
To change this, open the Allstarfooty.py file and change the 2nd line to read:
	directory = r'yourfoldereaddresshere'

To use the program, follow the prompts, or contact Qqqwxs on GitHub for help.
